# Primary Market

Primary Market is an over-the-counter trading platform that provides users with a marketplace for trading assets not yet listed on Blast, including but not limited to mottos, airdrops, whitelist access, and various other assets. Users are free to list any pre-market trading assets on the platform. Until June, the platform will not charge any fees. We will share fifty percent of the BLAST developer airdrops with users who trade on our platform. Additionally, all gas refunds from BLAST and profits generated by users during their staking period in our contract will be fully invested in top DeFi projects. Whether it's interest or BLAST airdrops, as well as the native tokens of DeFi projects, all rewards will be given to community users. The staked gas and profits will also be fully returned to community users at a specific time. This allows users to earn additional asset rewards while trading assets.
